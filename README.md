## Why Use Cirrus? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In today's dynamic cloud environments, identifying unauthorized or accidental changes is critical. Cirrus fills this gap by providing real-time visibility into your AWS provisioning events. It's not just another logging tool; it actively analyzes behavior and helps you answer critical questions like:

- Is someone provisioning resources in an unusual region?
- Is a new IAM user suddenly creating multiple S3 buckets?
- Has an EC2 instance been created with an unexpected type?

By focusing on these behavioral anomalies, Cirrus helps you detect potential security threats and prevent operational misconfigurations before they escalate. Its serverless architecture ensures it scales automatically with your needs and is highly cost-effective, so you only pay for what you use.
